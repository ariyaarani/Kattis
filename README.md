# Kattis Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) online judge, implemented in Python.

The solutions are primarily focused on beginner and intermediate-level problems and are written in a clean and concise manner, suitable for direct submission to the Kattis platform.

## Repository Structure

Each `.py` file corresponds to a single Kattis problem. The filename matches the problem's identifier on the Kattis website. For example:

```
hello.py â†’ https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello
```

## How to Use

You can run a solution locally by redirecting input from a file or by providing standard input manually. Example:

```bash
python3 problem_name.py < input.txt
```

Each script reads input from standard input and writes the result to standard output, as required by Kattis.
